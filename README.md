# BMarket App Project

This is an application going to use in civil engineering industry for their basic needs like man power, heavy machinery and raw materials to fulfill through online. It's completely User Responsive web application for enterprise companies. We used `React`, `Nextjs`, `Ant design` and `mongodb` for the development of BMarket Application.
